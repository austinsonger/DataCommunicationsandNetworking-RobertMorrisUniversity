Weekly Presentations*:**

**Almost every week you will be presenting a topic related to our
discussion. You should use power point. This is an individual work; you
must get the instructor permission if you would like to work with a
partner. Your presentation should be around 10 minutes long. You should
prepare three topics a week before your presentation. You will discuss
these topics with your instructor a week before the presentation. One
topic will be selected.**

Policies and Additional Information: 
=====================================

-   Students are expected to have read chapters or any assigned readings prior to class.
    ====================================================================================

-   Late Work Policy: Assignments are due at 6:00 PM, central time on the day of this course.  No exceptions are made and will receive a grade of 0.  Always back up your work as technical issues are not a reason to turn in assignments late.  Any uncoordinated, unexcused, missed exam will result in a score of 0 for that exam. 
    ===================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

-   Missed Exam. If you must miss the midterm exam (very few excuses are permitted) let me know as soon as possible before the scheduled exam. It is unlikely a make-up exam will be offered unless the student is ill or had an acceptable conflicting event.
    ==========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

-   It is imperative that you check Blackboard and your email account each day.
    ===========================================================================

-   Cell phones should be off or on silent during ALL class activities.
    ===================================================================

-   Professional behavior is expected from all students at all levels of communications, and conduct.
    =================================================================================================

<!-- -->

-   HW assignments and cases will be posted with more precision, weekly
    on blackboard under assignments.

-   Assignment submissions will only be accepted through the assignment
    link on blackboard, **NOT OTHERWISE**.

-   No make up for tests/quizzes over a week old, and scheduling subject
    to instructor’s discretion.

-   Feedback will be submitted through the assignment link only!

-   All students must comply with the policies that regulate all forms
    of academic dishonesty, or academic misconduct, including
    plagiarism, self-plagiarism, fabrication, deception, cheating, and
    sabotage.

***Changes may occur to the syllabus at the instructor's discretion.
When changes are made, students will be notified via an announcement in
