Week 1 Assignment - Chapter 1

(R1)
None at all. "Host" and "End System" basically means the same thing

(R3)
Standards are important for protocols so that people can create networking systems and products that interoperate.

(R4)
1. Dial-up modem(residential) 
2. DSL (residential or office) 
3. Cable to HFC (residential) 
4. 100 Mbps switched Etherent (company) 
5. Wireless LAN (mobile)
6. Cellular mobile access (Mobile Phone User)

(R5)
Shared. Packets are from a single source. No Collisions on the downstream channel.


(R7)
10 Mbps
100 Mbps
1 Gbps
10 Gbps

(R8)
Ethernet runs over twisted-pair copper wire (and fibers optic links).

(R9)
Dial up modems: = 56 Kbps, bandwidth is dedicated; 
ISDN: = 128 kbps, bandwidth is dedicated; 
ADSL: downstream channel = .5-8 Mbps, upstream channel = 1 Mbps, bandwidth is dedicated; 
HFC: downstream channel = 10-30 Mbps | upstream channel =< few Mbps, bandwidth is shared.

(R10)
a.	Wifi (802.11) (Wireless LAN), transmit/receive packets to/from an base station within a radius of few tens of meters, which is typically connected to the Internet and that connects wireless users to the physical wired network.

b.	3G/4G wireless access networks: Packets are transmitted over the same wireless infrastructure used for cellular telephony, with the base station thus being managed by a telecommunications provider.

(R15)
Google's private network connects all their data centers (DC's) 
Traffic - DC's passes over its private network.
Data centers are located near, or in, lower tier ISPs. 
Google delivers content to a user, bypasses higher tier ISPs. 

(1) the content provider has more control 
(2) Save money by sending less traffic into provider networks. 
(3) ISPs can decide to charge more money to rich content providers (enabling content providers to avoid paying uncessary payments).
