### R1. 

What does it mean for a wireless network to be operating in “infrastructure
mode?” If the network is not in infrastructure mode, what mode of operation
is it in, and what is the difference between that mode of operation and infrastructure
mode?

In infrastructure mode of operation, each wireless host is connected to the larger
network via a base station (access point). If not operating in infrastructure mode, a
network operates in ad-hoc mode. In ad-hoc mode, wireless hosts have no
infrastructure with which to connect. In the absence of such infrastructure, the
hosts themselves must provide for services such as routing, address assignment,
DNS-like name translation, and more.

### R2 

What are the four types of wireless networks identified in our taxonomy in
Section 6.1? Which of these types of wireless networks have you used?

a) Single hop, infrastructure-based
b) Single hop, infrastructure-less
c) Multi-hop, infrastructure-based
d) Multi-hop, infrastructure-less

### R3

What are the differences between the following types of wireless channel
impairments: path loss, multipath propagation, interference from other
sources?

Path loss is due to the attenuation of the electromagnetic signal when it travels
through matter. Multipath propagation results in blurring of the received signal at
the receiver and occurs when portions of the electromagnetic wave reflect off
objects and ground, taking paths of different lengths between a sender and
receiver. Interference from other sources occurs when the other source is also
transmitting in the same frequency range as the wireless network.

### R4

As a mobile node gets farther and farther away from a base station, what are
two actions that a base station could take to ensure that the loss probability of
a transmitted frame does not increase?

a) Increasing the transmission power
b) Reducing the transmission rate

### R5 

Describe the role of the beacon frames in 802.11.

APs transmit beacon frames. An AP’s beacon frames will be transmitted over one
of the 11 channels. The beacon frames permit nearby wireless stations to discover
and identify the AP.

Why are acknowledgments used in 802.11 but not in wired Ethernet?
